##### Let me bore you a litle - here's a remarkable story about an item lost and found:

> This is a story about Del Toro‚Äôs notebook
Guillermo Del Toro‚Äôs story is perhaps the most famous lost and found story in this list. 
Among his most prized possessions is a leather-bound journal that he carries with him at all times. 
It is where he sketches and writes down his ideas for future films. 
In this particular notebook was four years worth of ruminations that would eventually become El Labyrinth del Fauno (Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth). 
The movie almost never came to be, as Del Toro had exited a London cab one night and neglected to take his notebook with him. 
The cabbie found the notebook, as well as a scrap of paper with a hotel logo on it. 
Recognizing the logo, the cabbie returned the book and Del Toro was so excited with its return that he gave the cabbie a $900 reward.
